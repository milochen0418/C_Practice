Correct setting of what we expect is 
...


network={
   ssid="ittraining401"
   psk="itstudent"
}

We expect to write file into the filepath as ...

/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf


compile method
$ gcc main.c -o ./mywifi 

execute method for raspberry pi in the IT 401 classroom
$ ./mywifi ittraining401 itstudent


BTW,
./wpa_supplicant.conf can work for raspberry pi now
It's for you to refer
